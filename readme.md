This is a storage space for some of my first attempts at using Netlogo.
You will need Netlogo 5.* to run the models.
Download from
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/
If you don't use git just download all the files using the zip option. Git repositories show the source code, not the models.
Feel free to modify any of the models and extend them. Please push any useful changes back on a new branch if you do!
